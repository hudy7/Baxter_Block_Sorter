PCL Node:
    Identify top surface of the block
    Calculate centroid of the surface
    Determine orientation of block?
    Determine color of the surface

Motion Planning:
    Accept cartesian coordinate of centroid of block and block color
    Move gripper to that location and set to correct orientation

Gripper:
    Accept command to open and close gripper

HMI:
    Needs to recognize starting and stopping commands
    ar_track_alvar is open source ar tag tracking
    Other stopping and starting ideas: keyboard
